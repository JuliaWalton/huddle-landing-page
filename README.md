## My process

- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge was good for me to practice building responsive layouts quickly.

```css
@media (min-width: 1000px) {
  .product {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
    margin: clamp(3rem, 3vw, 3rem);
  }
  .icons {
    grid-column: 2 / 3;
    justify-content: right;
    position: relative;
    bottom: -50px;
  }
  .product-content {
    text-align: left;
    align-items: center;
    grid-template-rows: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(100px, 100%), 150px));
  }
}
```
